# [BUG] [WEB] `KeyboardListener`'s and `Focus.onKeyEvent`'s `KeyUpEvent` do not work correctly in JS and WASM builds

The `KeyboardListener` and `Focus.onKeyEvent` that replace `RawKeyboardListener` and `Focus.onKey` have a bug in triggering the `KeyUpEvent` correctly in the JS and WASM builds. The `KeyUpEvent` is not triggered when a key is released when pressing multiple keys in sequence and releasing them in reverse order. This bug is not present in VM builds.

A reproduction issue sample app is provided in the code sample section.

This issue reproduces on all current Flutter channels.

## Background

We discovered this bug after starting to more actively pushing and using WEB builds of the game platform [HypeHype](https://app.hypehype.com/).
We had already migrated from the deprecated `RawKeyboardListener` to the new `KeyboardListener` and its related APIs, but due to this issue we had to revert the migration and continue to use the deprecated `RawKeyboardListener` and its related APIs.

When making games, having correct n-key rollover function and n-key release sequence is critical, as game-play typically depends on being able to press multiple keys at the same time and having the game react correctly to their triggered key down and key up release order.

## Request to hold removal of deprecated `RawKeyboardListener` and related APIs until issue is fixed

We kindly ask if you can hold the removal of the deprecated `RawKeyboardListener` and its related APIs, until this issue is resolved and its fix has landed in the Flutter stable channel.

The  `RawKeyboardListener` and its related APIs are scheduled for removal here https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/136419 by @gspencergoog.


## Expected behaviour

When pressing multiple keys in sequence and releasing them in reverse order, the `KeyUpEvent` should be triggered for each key in the correct release order.

Using the reproduction keyboard event listener demo app, we can see that in a **VM build** the `KeyUpEvent` is triggered correctly for each key in the correct order.

**Using the VM build with `RawKeyboardListener` or `Focus.onKey` APIs**
1. Press and hold `[1]` then, press and hold `[2]` then press and hold `[3]`.
2. Release `[3]`, keep holding `[2]` and `[1]`.
3. Release `[2]`, keep holding `[1]`, the `RawKeyUpEvent` for `[2]` is triggered.
4. Release `[1]`, the `RawKeyUpEvent` for `[1]` is triggered.

This is CORRECT and **expected** behaviour.

**Using the VM build with `KeyboardListener` or `Focus.onKeyEvent` APIs**
1. Press and hold `[1]` then, press and hold `2` then press and hold `[3]`.
2. Release `[3]`, keep holding `[2]` and `[1]`.
3. Release `[2]`, keep holding `[1]`, the `KeyUpEvent` for `[2]` is triggered.
4. Release `[1]`, the `KeyUpEvent` for `[1]` is triggered.

This is CORRECT and **expected** behaviour.

This is demonstrated in the video recording below:

## Actual behavior

When pressing multiple keys in sequence and releasing them in reverse order, the `KeyUpEvent` is not triggered for each key in the correct order on WEB builds. The same incorrect result is present in both JS and WASM builds. The previous key that were pressed are triggered automatically when last key is released, slightly after it, or not at all.

**Using WEB VM build with `RawKeyboardListener` or `Focus.onKey` APIs**
1. Press and hold `[1]` then, press and hold `[2]` then press and hold `[3]`.
2. Release `[3]`, keep holding `[2]` and `[1]`.
3. Release `[2]`, keep holding `[1]`, the `RawKeyUpEvent` for `[2]` is triggered.
4. Release `[1]`, the `RawKeyUpEvent` for `[1]` is triggered.

This is CORRECT and **expected** behaviour.

**Using the VM build with `KeyboardListener` or `Focus.onKeyEvent` APIs**
1. Press and hold `[1]` then, press and hold `[2]` then press and hold `[3]`.
2. Release `[3]`, keep holding `[2]` and `[1]`, the `KeyUpEvent` for `[2]` is triggered shortly after, despite `[2]` still being pressed.
3. Release `[2]`, keep holding `[1]`, the actual `KeyUpEvent` for `[2]` is not triggered.
4. Release `[1]`, the `KeyUpEvent` for `1` is not triggered.

This is incorrect and **not expected** behaviour when using the `KeyboardListener` and related APIs on WEB builds.
